            <br>
            <br>
            <h3>Reasons to read web development blogs
            </h3>
            <p>If you’re in the web development business, you can take it that you’ll never be done learning. In fact,
                even
                the best around admit that there’s always something new to learn. Sounds daunting, right? That doesn’t
                have
                to be so.</p>
            <br>
            <h4>Learn from those who’ve been there</h4>
            <p>Due to the nature of a web developer’s job, it pays to stay on top of all the latest trends and
                developments
                (no pun intended!) in the industry. An easy way to do this is to follow web development blogs. Blogs are
                especially helpful if you’re freelancing it, to ensure the services you offer your clients are
                continuously
                based on the latest solutions on the market.</p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <h4>Know the tools of the trade</h4>
            <p>Furthermore, being a developer isn’t just about knowing how to code – it’s about knowing how to use the
                tools
                of the trade, specifically developer tools. Reading tutorials and learning about all their different
                features could also help you get ahead in your career.</p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <h4>Grow your skillbase</h4>
            <p>Lastly, web development is one of those disciplines that “where there’s a will, there’s a way” definitely
                rings true. It’s one of those areas where, if you’re willing to put in the work, the rest usually takes
                care
                of itself.</p>
            <p>Whether you’re an experienced developer, or a newbie, there’s always something new to learn or practice.
                Among the best out there is David Walsh, who works for Mozilla. David places practice above theory in
                order
                of importance. He believes that developers should never fear experimentation and always be willing to
                dabble
                in unknown areas. He’s also a stern believer in the fail-fast Agile methodology. We’ve actually included
                his
                blog in the list below!</p>
            <p>You can become more adventurous by reading up on all subject matters relating to the art of web
                development.
                And trust us when we say there’s plenty of free material on the web</p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <h4>Where do I start?</h4>
            <p>The question is where to start. The sheer variety of content out there can leave one feeling perplexed
                and
                nonplussed about where to start. Is it better to read blog posts? Is it better to follow blogs that
                offer
                more tutorials? Or more freebies? Is it better to watch and learn from videos?</p>
